# Algorithms: Books, Classic Papers and Cutting‑Edge Research

Algorithms are central to computer science and engineering.  This curated list groups essential literature into three categories:

* **Books** – comprehensive or specialized works that teach algorithm design and analysis.  Where possible, I note when a book is available through O’Reilly’s ebook library (O’Reilly or similar).
* **Classic / Foundational / Influential papers** – seminal publications that introduced key algorithmic ideas or complexity‑theoretic concepts.
* **Cutting‑edge research** – recent work pushing algorithmic boundaries, often using machine learning or novel theoretical insights.

## Notes on Availability and Specialization

* **O’Reilly availability:** Books explicitly published by O’Reilly (for example **Algorithms in a Nutshell**) should be accessible via the O’Reilly ebook library.  Other titles may or may not be available; check the library for each.
* **Further specialization:** Algorithms is a vast field.  For deeper study one might create separate lists for categories like **randomized algorithms**, **approximation algorithms**, **graph & network algorithms**, **string algorithms** or **optimization**.  Let me know if you’d like these specialized lists.
