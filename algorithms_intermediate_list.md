### Descriptions and rationale

* **The Algorithm Design Manual (Skiena)** – This practical textbook removes the “mystery” from algorithm design and analysis and is widely used as both a course text and an interview preparation guide.  The publisher describes the third edition as continuing to provide accessible instruction on designing and analysing algorithms, while its second part acts as a “Hitchhiker’s Guide” cataloguing combinatorial algorithms and implementations【604567261072099†L81-L94】.  The book’s emphasis on algorithmic design over purely mathematical analysis and its extensive resource section make it an ideal intermediate‑level reference.

* **Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java (Weiss)** – Pearson’s overview notes that this text “is an advanced algorithms book that fits between traditional CS2 and Algorithms Analysis courses,” making it appropriate for first‑year graduate or advanced undergraduate students【453358807560472†L34-L44】.  Weiss pairs programming with analysis to teach readers how to develop efficient Java programs and covers topics ranging from binary heaps and sorting to NP‑completeness.  A dedicated chapter on amortized analysis and advanced data structures, accompanied by figures illustrating algorithm stages, provides a rigorous yet accessible treatment【453358807560472†L34-L51】.

* **The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms (Aho, Hopcroft & Ullman)** – This classic text introduces the fundamental concepts behind efficient algorithms.  A back‑cover synopsis explains that it introduces the basic data structures and programming techniques used in efficient algorithms, covering lists, push‑down stacks, queues, trees and graphs before delving into sorting, searching, graph algorithms, string‑matching algorithms and the Schönhage–Strassen integer‑multiplication algorithm【417079155694363†L88-L94】.  Numerous graded exercises make it suitable for intermediate courses.

* **Network Flows: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications (Ahuja, Magnanti & Orlin)** – Google Books describes this 846‑page tome as a comprehensive introduction that unifies classical and contemporary aspects of network flows【271924680222558†L60-L79】.  It provides self‑contained treatments of shortest‑path, maximum‑flow and minimum‑cost‑flow problems and presents polynomial‑time algorithms for these core models.  The book emphasizes algorithmic strategies such as data scaling and geometric improvement arguments and explains important data structures (e.g., d‑heaps, Fibonacci heaps, dynamic trees)【271924680222558†L60-L79】.  With over 150 application examples and a chapter on empirical testing, it bridges theory and practice.

* **Algorithm Design (Kleinberg & Tardos)** – The Shepherd description notes that this textbook introduces algorithms by looking at the real‑world problems that motivate them.  It teaches a range of design and analysis techniques and encourages an understanding of the algorithm design process rather than rote memorisation【278851980974523†L39-L43】.  The authors’ conversational yet rigorous tone, solved examples and applications to realistic problems (including a celebrated maximum‑flow chapter) make it a fitting companion for intermediate‑level study.

## Notable algorithms and papers

These classic algorithms and data structures form the core of intermediate‑level study.  The table gives each algorithm or paper, its era and key ideas.  Brief explanations with citations follow.

| **Tarjan’s strongly connected components algorithm** | 1972 | depth‑first search; linear‑time identification of strongly connected components |
| **Disjoint‑set (Union–find) data structure** | 1975 | near‑constant amortised time; union by rank and path compression |

### Explanations

* **Knuth–Morris–Pratt (KMP) algorithm** – KMP was developed by James Morris and independently by Donald Knuth, then published jointly in 1977.  It is a string‑searching algorithm that scans a text S for occurrences of a pattern W by exploiting information gleaned from partial matches to avoid re‑examining characters【376525079538250†L157-L170】.  By using a failure (prefix) function, KMP achieves linear‑time search complexity and laid the foundation for efficient pattern matching.

* **Floyd–Warshall algorithm** – The Floyd–Warshall algorithm computes the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a directed weighted graph (with no negative cycles) using dynamic programming【716690119455482†L161-L198】.  It incrementally improves path estimates by considering intermediate vertices and is guaranteed to find all shortest paths using Θ(|V|^3) comparisons【716690119455482†L192-L198】.  The algorithm was published in its modern form by Robert Floyd in 1962 and is closely related to earlier work by Bernard Roy and Stephen Warshall【716690119455482†L161-L180】.

* **Tarjan’s strongly connected components algorithm** – Robert Tarjan’s 1972 algorithm identifies the strongly connected components of a directed graph in linear time using depth‑first search.  The algorithm performs a DFS while maintaining a stack of visited vertices; each vertex remains on the stack until all of its reachable vertices have been explored, allowing the algorithm to recover strongly connected components as subtrees of the DFS forest【669273935161465†L140-L167】.  Its linear‑time complexity makes it a cornerstone of graph algorithm courses.

* **Disjoint‑set (Union–find) data structure** – Disjoint‑set data structures maintain a collection of non‑overlapping sets and support operations to unify sets and find the representative of a set.  Disjoint‑set forests with union‑by‑rank and path compression achieve near‑constant amortised time complexity for a sequence of operations; Tarjan proved this upper bound in 1975 and showed it is tight【901815002627488†L190-L200】.  Union–find is a key tool for connectivity algorithms, spanning trees and Kruskal’s minimum‑spanning‑tree algorithm.

* **Network flow fundamentals** – Augmenting‑path algorithms such as Ford–Fulkerson and Edmonds–Karp form the basis for network flow theory.  They iteratively improve a feasible flow along augmenting paths to reach a maximum flow; the max‑flow min‑cut theorem links the value of the maximum flow to the capacity of the minimum cut.  Edmonds and Karp’s refinement ensures polynomial‑time performance by selecting shortest augmenting paths.
